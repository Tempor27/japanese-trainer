# Japanese Trainer App

This is an app I created to help me practice Japanese. The content is inspired by the Japanese courses I took at UMBC. 

The front end of the app is implemented using TKinter. The rest is implemented in python. There is an executable version and also 
a python file featured in this repo. Both require the font type provided on the repo to be in the same folder as the program being run.

There are some bugs that have not been fixed, mainly with the front end, that will be addressed in a later update.
